What is SmartCan? What is our Cause?
========
Tired of carrying a heavy garbage can and always ripping it? Missing your opportunity to take the trash out at the right time? It is easy to ignore the mundane task of dumping the garbage as it fills up. When attempting to close the bag, the bag rips. Now your garbage is all over the ground. Introducing the first residential smart garbage can! The "SmartCan" is a cloud-connected garbage can that informs you of when it is the perfect time to take out your trash.

Design Process:
========
The SmartCan comes with sensors installed to report your trashcan's current height and weight directly to YOU, the user. It automatically connects to your smartphone through our app to keep you updated. Based on your settings, you can choose whether you want to be notified once a day, or only if the height or weight exceeds a fixed level. That means no more late night panicking when it's time to dump the garbage. There are also plans to add built-in aeorsol dispensers throughout the entire height of the can, so your trash will never smell!

Sensors, Materials and Resources Used:

FSR 406 Weight/Force Sensor: http://www.interlinkelectronics.com

Sharp GP2Y0A21YK Infrared Proximity Sensor 10-80cm: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/242

Sharp GP2D120XJ00F Analog Distance Sensor 4-30cm: http://www.pololu.com/product/1136

These devices will allow us to measure the weight of the scale and the height of the garbage and send the information to the cloud.

How Does it Work?:
========
SmartCan works because of the Spark Core, a web-enabled device that can connect to the cloud. It uploads data from the connected devices to the Internet. That data is then read by our free iOS app.

How Did we Construct our Product?
========
We connected our peripheral devices to the Spark Core . This involves wiring the distance sensor into the circuit, and hacking into the digital scale’s load cell to connect it to our core. After that is done, we go about putting together the pieces and creating the product.

Marketing Strategies:
========
We beta tested potential customers who were interested in our product, by handing out flyers and posting information about our invention on social media. We then email the list of people who signed up for the beta a few questions and wait for their responses. Based on what they reply, we will figure out how how we can improve on our original protoype.

Plans/Goals:
========
Be smart. Know how much you waste. Cut your waste. The SmartCan will accurately monitor how much you throw out and will keep the data current and updated on your phone. It has options to see how much you waste in a given week, month, or year. Let this make an impact in your life. Do your part. Help fix the environment.
