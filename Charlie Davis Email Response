How accurate is the weight sensor at the upper range?  How high can that sensor go?  Please clear this up.  I use a very large garbage can that is upwards of 5 feet.  Is there any way that the height sensor has accurate range this high?

The product is creative and I think there is some room for growth here.  I'm not sure how to modify it, but it is a good start.
