Extra Information We Did Not Have Time to Include in the Presentation (Progress/Previous Steps in More Depth): 

Up until now, we have done many things related to the project. After brainstorming ideas and coming up with a final invention, we
got into our groups and then decided on our final plans about what we want to do with the SmartCan. We were then told about our 
$119.00 budget, which we decided to use in order to purchase our materials. My partners and I have gone to the drawing board and 
decided what it is we will need to implement the design and structure of our SmartCan. We have reached the decision to include one
SHARP Distance Sensor, ranging from 4-30cm. This sensor will use reflected infrared light to measure the distance the garbage is 
away from the sensor. This is helpful in determining a good base limit as to where to garbage should stop being filled. The SHARP
IR Sensor was received for free from Dino on the 6th floor. There is also a weight sensor that will be hacked to measure the 
weight of the garbage and then will send the data to the Spark Core. The Spark Core will then send a notification to your phone 
via cloud, telling you the bag is getting too heavy. The digital scale was $32.65. Finally, the Spark Core was purchased for 
$39.00. The Spark Core was programmed into our Wi-Fi, allowing access to begin using it to program our scale and IR sensor. 
This still gives us enough money to be able to experiment with installing aerosol cans to keep the odor of the SmartCan very 
freshening. We will now work with the technicalities of designing the can after we beta test potential customers to decide what we
will set our base price at, as long as it is more than what it takes for us to build the product.
