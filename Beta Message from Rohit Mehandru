I spoke to a friend of mine who studies Electrical Engineering at StonyBrook University.  He spoke to a professor there who teaches the class on Engineering Economics and he wrote me a quote from the professor's email.  

"I think you guys need to step back and see if you're solving a real problem that people have every day. Maybe your technology has use in other applications where there are real problems that need to be solved. There have been commercial uses of this tech where dumpsters in busy cities can detect which dumpsters are filled and therefore can plan routes accordingly to only pick up full dumpsters. Even they are struggling as a startup and their application is great. Your idea is not useless, it is simply useless in the consumer market."
