The whole idea of a smart garbage can came to mind when one of our fellow classmates went to throw something out. After throwing
out his garbage, he looked up and said, "I wish that can was 'smart'". Once the rest of the ideas were developed, he followed
the path to another project, while the four of us thought of ways to improve on making a garbage can "smart". We decided to
include weight sensors, IR sensors and possibly aerosol cans to improve a normal garbage can and then all of the data will be used
to notify users of the can of various aspects. A sparkcore was used to translate the data from one place (the trash), to another
(the user). We then conducted alpha tests that were not noted to be that important and then finally planned on conducting beta 
tests of the public to see what THEY truly believe about our product. But what does "smart" mean to begin with? What are some of 
the other words used? Read along to be able to get a good understanding of what the SmartCan is about.

"smart" - the word "smart" is used to refer to technology in this aspect. According to gcn.com, "smart technology is about 
          squeezing big performance improvements out of everything from electric grids and transportation networks to water supply
          systems and health care services by trying to align constrained supply with erratic demand more systematically." In 
          other words, the term "smart" relates to anything that is electronically connected to the cloud (internet) via a device
          (such as an arduino or rasberry pi) and can possibly send data to it.
